### 1. MUST KNOW TOPICS
    |
    |__ The Three main pillars of DSA are `DATA STRUCTURES`, `ALGORITHMS`, Problem-Solving Technikues`

### 2. LEARn ONE TOPIC AT A TIME
    |
    |__ Begin with linear data structures like arrays, linked lists, stack, kues.
    |
    |__ Follow the order bellow.

### 3. HOW TO START LEARNING A NEW TOPIC
    |
    |__ Start with basics by learning what it is? How it represented in code? Differenct operations you can perform on it/ Use Cases? And Their Time/space complexities.
    |
    |__ Understand where and how it is used in Real Wrold scenarios/ Real World Application.
    |
    |__ Use Pen and Paper.
    |
    |__ Implement it From scratch. Write code to implement the data structure on algorithm from scratch
    |
    |__ Learn the Inbuild library functions. Learn how to use standard libraries in your language that provide data structures and algorithms.
    |
    |__ Solve Simple Problems. Practice simple problems related to the topic to build confidence.

### HOW TO SCALE YOUR DSA KNOLEDGE
    |
    |__ Prioritize Solving problems over theory. Real learning happens when you apply that knowledge to solve problems.
    |
    |__ Challenge yourself
    |
    |__ Understand Don't memorize. Focus on Understanding the underlying conceps and principles.
    |
    |__ Think in Patterns. Many problems share underlying patterns. recognize these patterns can help you kuickly identify the right approach to solve the new problem.

### RETAIN WHAT YOU LEARn
    |
    |__ Repitition is key to transferring knowledge from short-term to long-term.
    |
    |__ Create Revision List.
    |
    |__ Bookmark anything Important.
